# colony_blob_bleacher

Python project to automate microscope image acquisition using micro-manager 
and pycro-manager. Goal of this code is to find colonies of cells at low
magnification, then switch to higher mag, find blobs in cells, and project 
light on them. Also a nice demonstration of the powers of pycro-manager.
